An important one is:
	privacy in using IOT. Suppose you are a customer.
	When you will know that this set is working in a server basis which is collecting your private data, you won't use that like you used to.
	Also you will introduce it with some bad features. This destroyes the set, our brand, our team and the supports behind us.
	If you don't have any belief in this set, you'll announce it negatively.
	in other hands, if someone else wanted to be a competiter in front of us, this issue will be an excuse to make us weaker and weaker.
	We are eager to have some information about the families. The next step is data analysis in that field.
	For instance about the quantity and quality of a home's air that is breathing and then compare with air outdoors.
	Finally a complete analysis that eventually may give us a new idea for a new job and new movement.
	*This is the question*:
	HOW WE CAN MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE ON THIS SET SO THEY ARE NOT WORRY ABOUT THEIR PRIVACY?
	AND ALSO WHAT'S OUR PLAN AND ANSWER JUST NOT TO BE WEAKER AND FAIL WHEN SOMEONE IS ADVERTISING IN A WAY OPPOSITE TO OURS VIA ABUSING OUR IOT OPTION?
